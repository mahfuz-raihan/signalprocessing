### Questions are given here
1. Write a program to generate the continuous time signal (i) y(t) = cos(t), 0=< t =< 10             (ii) y(t) = 3*cos(3*Pi*t+pi/4) for four periods  (iii) y(t) = 2e^-0.9t. plot all the signals in a single figure

2. Write a program to generate the continuous time (i) unit step (ii) unit impulse (iii) ramp and  (iv) periodic sinusoidal sequence. Plot all the signals in a single figure.

3. Write a program to generate the discrete time (i) unit step (ii) unit impulse (iii) ramp and  (iv) periodic sinusoidal sequence. Plot all the signals in a single figure.

4. write a program to perform the following operation on continuous time signals (i) addition (ii) subtraction (iii) multiplication (iv) amplitude and time scaling and (v) odd and even components of a signal.

5. Write a program to verify the following  properties of a given system in continuous/discrete-time (i) Causal and Non-causal System (ii) Static (Memory less) and Dynamic(with Memory) System (iii) Linear and Nonlinear System and (iv) Time-Invariant and Time-variant System. 

6. Write a program to convolve two continuous time signals. Plots all the sequences. Verify the result by analytical calculation.

7. Write a program to convolve two discrete time signals. Plots all the sequences. Verify the result by analytical calculation.

8. Write a program to perform transformations of signals into time and frequency domains.

9. Find the Fourier transform of a square pulse. Plot it's amplitude and phase spectrum. 

10. Generate a discrete time sequence by sampling a continuous time signal. Show that with sampling rates less then Nyquist rate, aliasing occurs while reconstructing the signal.

11. The signals x(t) is defined as below. The signal is sampled at a sampling rate of 1000 samples per second. Find the power content and power spectral density for the signal.

    x(t) = {cos(2*pi*47*t)+cos(2*pi*219*t), 0=< t =< 10 | 0, otherwise}

12. Write a program to find the magnitude and phase response of first order loss pass and high pass filter. Plot the response in logarithmic scale.

13. Write a program to find the response of low pass filter and high pass filter, when a speech signal through these filters.
