# signal_processing
This repository made for signal processing lab for student, the script written in python. Hope you will enjoy

### Questions are given here
1. Write a program to generate the continuous time signal (i) y(t) = cos(t), 0=< t =< 10             (ii) y(t) = 3*cos(3*Pi*t+pi/4) for four periods  (iii) y(t) = 2e^-0.9t. plot all the signals in a single figure
2. Write a program to generate the continuous time (i) unit step (ii) unit impulse (iii) ramp and  (iv) periodic sinusoidal sequence. Plot all the signals in a single figure.
3. Write a program to generate the discrete time (i) unit step (ii) unit impulse (iii) ramp and  (iv) periodic sinusoidal sequence. Plot all the signals in a single figure.
4. write a program to perform the following operation on continuous time signals (i) addition (ii) subtraction (iii) multiplication (iv) amplitude and time scaling and (v) odd and even components of a signal.
